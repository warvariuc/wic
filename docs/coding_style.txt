One of Guido's key insights is that code is read much more often than it
    is written.  The guidelines provided here are intended to improve the
    readability of code and make it consistent across the wide spectrum of
    Python code.

Modules should have short, all-lowercase names.  Underscores can be used
      in the module name if it improves readability.

Indentation

	4 spaces are used for indentation
	Spaces, not tabs!


Declaring variables

	Declare each variable on a separate line
	Avoid short (e.g. “a”, “rbarr”, “nughdeget”) names whenever possible
	Single character variable names are only okay for counters and temporaries, where the purpose of the variable is obvious
	Variables and functions start with a lower-case letter. Each consecutive word in a variable’s name starts with an upper-case letter
	Classes always start with an upper-case letter.
	Avoid abbreviations

		// Wrong
		short Cntr;
		char ITEM_DELIM = '\t';

		// Correct
		short counter;
		char itemDelimiter = '\t';


Keep lines shorter than 100 characters; insert breaks if necessary.


Commas go at the end of a broken line; operators start at the beginning of the new line. The operator is at the end of the line to avoid having to scroll if your editor is too narrow.

// Correct
if (longExpression
    + otherLongExpression
    + otherOtherLongExpression) {
}

// Wrong
if (longExpression +
    otherLongExpression +
    otherOtherLongExpression) {


Feel free to break a rule if it makes your code look bad.
