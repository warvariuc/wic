если дизайнер не видит виджеты, на установить пакет python2.6-dev

>Turns out there is a dependency on python2.6-dev, specifically /usr/lib/libpython2.6.so
on Windows make sure that this file exists: c:\Python26\Lib\site-packages\PyQt4\python26.dll (т.е. дизайнер должен видеть библиотеку питона - можно и пути прописать)


Most of the good tech companies, major web companies, etc. have gotten their start not because of an idea person, but because of a programmer who had an idea. Programmers (and, to some degree, non-programmer computer power users) are much more likely to have a concept of what's possible, practical, and useful in technology. The farther you get from that, the less likely you are to have a good idea. Either way, the first thing you should do if you have an idea is to discuss it with people who do have a background in programming. Don't be surprised if it gets shot down as impossible or impractical.
