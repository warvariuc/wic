It is a DAL (Database Abstraction Layer) *and* ORM (Object-Relational Mapper).
The design is driven by the idea to have Python IDE autocomplete work.
Django ORM has *too* much magic - you have too look into docs to know all the params.
In our case the code is trying to be self-explanatory. Using autocomplete and code following you can
find out all params and their meaning.


Models and database tables are named in singular.

>I stick with Singular for table names and any programming entity. The reason? The fact that there
are irregular plurals in English like mouse --> mice and sheep --> sheep.

city -> cities ?
